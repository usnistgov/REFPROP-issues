I have encountered wrong values from RefProp using Excel
Example:
  =Entropy("R134a","Th","SI",368,402.505)
should return 1.60000000
instead
it returns 1.19171415
I am working on a graduate studies requirement using RefProp data, unfortunately, I cannot do it in Excel because it returns wrong values.
In MatLab, it returns the proper values:
 refpropm('S','T',368,'H',402505,'R134a')
 ans =
1.6000e+03
Coding is a bit tedious, however, if it would only be possible to use Excel with macros, it would have been much more easier.
Kindly please enlighten what NIST is been doing to fix the issue
Thanks
